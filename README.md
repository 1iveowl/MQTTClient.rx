### Credits
This project is based on [MQTTnet](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet) by Christian Kratky. Without his work, this library would not be. All this library really is, is a Rx wrapper around MQTTnet. 

### Why This Library
[MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) and [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io/) (aka. ReactiveX or just Rx) are perfect for each other! 

Rx is an API for asynchronous programming
with observable streams. MQTT is a protocol that produces asynchronous streams.

That is why I created this library!

### How to use
Using the library is super easy. Rx. makes is easy to write code in a declarative manager. It is IMHO more elegant to use than Events.
